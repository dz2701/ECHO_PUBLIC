So, here is the prioritization method that I generally use:
Students choose a preferred season for module #1
Students are ranked seniors, juniors, then sophomores for module 1
Students are then ranked within their class by timestamp.
Classes are maxed out at 16 (with the exception of a few select classes -- I can provide the list)
If a class is full and the student selects the class as his/her first choice, he/she is then enrolled in their second class choice, an so on and so forth.
Students then choose their second preference for season to take a module.
Students are ranked again by class, however, a senior's second selection is prioritized after a sophomore's first choice.
Ultimately, there are some other niceties that I would love to have incorporated, but I'm not sure how it would work."
